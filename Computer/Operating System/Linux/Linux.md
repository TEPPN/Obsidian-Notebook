# What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various operating systems known as Linux distributions. It is widely used in servers, development environments, and embedded systems due to its stability, security, and flexibility.

# History of Linux

Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a hobby project while he was a student at the University of Helsinki. Since then, it has grown into a major operating system, supported by a large community and corporations worldwide.

# Features of Linux

- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute.
    
- **Multiuser & Multitasking**: Supports multiple users and processes simultaneously.
    
- **Security**: Built-in security features such as user permissions, firewalls, and encryption.
    
- **Stability**: Reliable for servers and critical systems.
    
- **Customizability**: Can be tailored to specific needs with different distributions and configurations.
    
- **Portability**: Runs on various hardware architectures.
    

# Linux Distributions

A Linux distribution (distro) is an operating system made from a Linux kernel, system utilities, and package management tools. Popular distributions include:

- **Ubuntu** - User-friendly and widely used.
    
- **Debian** - Stable and community-driven.
    
- **Fedora** - Cutting-edge technology and features.
    
- **CentOS/RHEL** - Enterprise-focused and highly stable.
    
- **[[Arch Linux]]** - Minimalist and highly customizable.
    
- **Kali Linux** - Security and penetration testing.
    

# Linux File System Structure

- `/` - [[Root]] directory (everything starts here)
    
- `/home` - User home directories
    
- `/bin` - Essential binary files
    
- `/etc` - Configuration files
    
- `/var` - Log files and variable data
    
- `/tmp` - Temporary files
    
- `/usr` - User applications and utilities
    
- `/boot` - [[Boot loader]] files
    

# Basic Linux Commands

- `ls` - List files and directories
    
- `cd` - Change directory
    
- `pwd` - Print working directory
    
- `mkdir` - Create a directory
    
- `rm` - Remove files or directories
    
- `cp` - Copy files or directories
    
- `mv` - Move or rename files
    
- `cat` - Display file contents
    
- `nano`, `vim` - Text editors
    

# Why Use Linux?

- **Security**: Less vulnerable to malware and viruses.
    
- **Performance**: Efficient resource management.
    
- **Flexibility**: Can be customized for various applications.
    
- **Community Support**: Large community and open-source contributions.
    
- **Cost-effective**: No licensing fees.
    

# Conclusion

Linux is a powerful, secure, and flexible operating system used by developers, system administrators, and businesses worldwide. Learning Linux is essential for anyone interested in software development, cybersecurity, or IT infrastructure.
