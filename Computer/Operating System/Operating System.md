# Introduction to Operating Systems

An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources while providing essential services for applications. It acts as an intermediary between users and the hardware.

# Functions of an Operating System

- **Process Management**: Handles running applications, multitasking, and process scheduling.
    
- **Memory Management**: Allocates and manages RAM usage.
    
- **File System Management**: Organizes and controls access to data storage.
    
- **Device Management**: Controls input/output devices.
    
- **Security & Access Control**: Protects against unauthorized access.
    
- **Networking**: Facilitates communication between devices.
    
- **[[User Interface]]**: Provides CLI ([[Command-Line Interface]]) and GUI ([[Graphical User Interface]]).
    

# Types of Operating Systems

1. **Batch Operating System**: Executes batches of jobs without user interaction.
    
2. **Time-Sharing Operating System**: Allows multiple users to access the system concurrently.
    
3. **Distributed Operating System**: Coordinates multiple machines as a single system.
    
4. **Embedded Operating System**: Designed for specialized devices like IoT and appliances.
    
5. **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**: Ensures strict timing constraints, used in robotics and automation.
    

# Popular Operating Systems

- **[[Windows]]**: Developed by Microsoft, known for its GUI and wide software support.
    
- **[[Linux]]**: Open-source, flexible, and widely used in servers.
    
- **[[macOS]]**: Appleâ€™s Unix-based OS known for its security and design.
    
- **[[Unix]]**: A multiuser OS serving as the foundation for Linux and BSD.
    
- **[[Android & iOS]]**: Mobile operating systems based on Linux and Unix.
    

# [[kernel]] Types

- **[[Monolithic Kernel]]**: Entire OS functions run in kernel mode (e.g., Linux, Unix).
    
- **[[Microkernel]]**: Minimal core functions, with services running in user space (e.g., QNX, Minix).
    
- **[[Hybrid Kernel]]**: Combination of monolithic and microkernel features (e.g., Windows NT, macOS).
    

# Process and Thread Management

- **Process**: A running program instance with allocated resources.
    
- **Thread**: The smallest executable unit within a process.
    
- **Scheduling Algorithms**:
    
    - First-Come, First-Served ([[FCFS]])
        
    - Shortest Job Next ([[SJN]])
        
    - Shortest Job First ([[SJF]])
        
    - Round Robin ([[RR]])
        
    - [[Multi-Level Queue Scheduling]]
        

# Memory Management Techniques

- **[[Paging]]**: Divides memory into fixed-size blocks.
    
- **[[Segmentation]]**: Divides memory logically based on program structures.
    
- **[[Virtual Memory]]**: Uses disk space as an extension of RAM.
    

# File System Concepts

- **[[FAT32]], [[NTFS ]]([[Windows]])**
    
- **[[EXT4]] ([[Linux]])**
    
- **[[APFS]], [[HFS]]+ ([[macOS]])**
    
- **Distributed File Systems ([[NFS]], [[SMB]], [[DFS]])**
    

# Security Aspects

- **Authentication & Authorization**: User verification and permission control.
    
- **[[Encryption]]**: Protects data at rest and in transit.
    
- **[[Firewall]] & [[Antivirus]]**: Prevents external threats.
    
- **[[SELinux ]]& AppArmor**: Mandatory access controls in Linux.
    

# Conclusion

Understanding operating systems is crucial for developers, system administrators, and cybersecurity professionals. Mastering OS concepts improves efficiency in software development, troubleshooting, and system optimization.
