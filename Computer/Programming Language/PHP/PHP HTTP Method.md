# Introduction to HTTP Methods in [[PHP]]

When a web form is submitted, the data is sent to the server using HTTP request methods. The two most commonly used methods in PHP are:

- **GET**
- **POST**

These methods define how the form data is sent and processed by the server.

# The GET Method

## **Definition**

The `$_GET` method sends data through the URL. The data is appended to the URL in key-value pairs.

## **Characteristics of GET Method**

- Data is visible in the URL.
- Can be bookmarked and cached.
- Used for retrieving data, not modifying it.
- Limited amount of data (based on URL length restrictions).

## **Example: Using GET in a Form**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <form action="process.php" method="GET">
    Name: <input type="text" name="username">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## **Processing GET Data in PHP**

```php
// process.php
if (isset($_GET['username'])) {
    echo "Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($_GET['username']);
}
```

## **When to Use GET?**

- When retrieving data (e.g., search queries, filters, navigation links).
- When sharing URLs with data (e.g., ?page=2).

## **When NOT to Use GET?**

- When handling sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal data).
- When sending large amounts of data.

# The POST Method

## **Definition**

The `$_POST` method sends data in the request body, making it invisible in the URL.

## **Characteristics of POST Method**

- Data is not visible in the URL.
- More secure than GET (not exposed in browser history/logs).
- No data size limitation.
- Used for submitting forms, updating data, or sending confidential information.

## **Example: Using POST in a Form**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <form action="process.php" method="POST">
    Name: <input type="text" name="username">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## **Processing POST Data in PHP**

```php
// process.php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    if (isset($_POST['username'])) {
        echo "Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($_POST['username']);
    }
}
```

## **When to Use POST?**

- When submitting sensitive information (e.g., passwords, forms with personal data).
- When sending large amounts of data.
- When performing actions that modify data (e.g., inserting into a database).

## **When NOT to Use POST?**

- When bookmarking or sharing a URL with form data.
- When the action should be idempotent (safe to repeat, like retrieving data).

# Differences Between GET and POST

|Feature|GET|POST|
|---|---|---|
|Data Visibility|Visible in URL|Hidden from URL|
|Security|Less secure|More secure|
|Data Limit|Limited by URL length|No size limit|
|Usage|Retrieve data|Submit or update data|
|Bookmarkable|Yes|No|

# Security Considerations

- Always validate and sanitize `$_GET` and `$_POST` inputs using `htmlspecialchars()` or `filter_input()`.
- Use `POST` for sensitive information to prevent exposure in browser history.
- Implement CSRF protection when using `POST` to prevent unauthorized form submissions.

# Conclusion

Understanding `$_GET` and `$_POST` is essential for handling form data in PHP. Use `GET` for data retrieval and `POST` for sending or modifying sensitive data. Always implement proper security practices to protect user inputs and prevent vulnerabilities.
